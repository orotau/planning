This project is somewhat of a botch but it does work after a fashion

TO RUN YOU WILL HAVE TO CHANGE THE FOLDER IDS (SEE CODE)

Notes
1. The purpose is to create a set of document planning skeletons for Topic and Maths
2. The files are created in msword and then uploaded to google as google docs. They are NOT overwritten on google.
3. The files have to be deleted from your machine manually
4. It should run ok for term 4
5. It will not work for any term that does not begin on a Monday
6. Deprecated code is present to add borders to the table (for the maths docs)

Some Issues
a) The files are created as google docs to prevent accidental duplication when using the google ui
b) If the week number had been added to the daily events in the calendar then this would have made things easier. This could be an enhancement
c) The formatting of the maths docs is "taken over" by google


I had to create a separate authorise file to run first time
as was getting an error otherwise...

  warnings.warn(_MISSING_FILE_MESSAGE.format(filename))
